[unpublished]

# 2.0.1

- Do not throw exceptions `window.opener` existed but has already closed.
- Do not throw exceptions when a `frame.postMessage` is denied.
- Exceptions are no longer thrown when `publish`, `subscribe` or `unsubscribe` were invoked directly.

  ```javascript
  var publish = framebus.publish;
  publish("event");
  ```

  # 2.0.0

- Breaking change: use of `origin` as a parameter for `publish`, `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` has been moved to the chaining-function `target(origin)`
- Added feature: events can be published with multiple arguments. If the last argument is a function, it is treated as a callback that subscribers can call.
- Added feature: `include(popup)` adds popups to the listing of frames to be messaged.
- Added feature: `window.opener` will now be included in framebus messaging, if available.

  # 1.0.0
